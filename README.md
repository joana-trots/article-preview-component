## Overview

This is a solution to the Article preview component.
Share button implemented in three different ways, that's why we have three html files: 

1. index.html - use hover effect
2. index-alt.html - use checkbox method (alternate way)
3. index-withjs - use JS (onclick and onmouseleave) (another alternate way)

NOTE: the way the button is displayed on small screen is the same in all files. Sorry, got a little lazy :)

File script.js is only used in index-withjs.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See the social media share links when they click the share icon
